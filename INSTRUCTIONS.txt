Step 1: Install Composer (if you haven't already)
Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. If you don't have Composer installed, you can install it by following these steps:

Download Composer:

bash
Copy code
php -r "copy('https://getcomposer.org/installer', 'composer-setup.php');"
Install Composer:

bash
Copy code
php composer-setup.php
Move Composer to a global location (optional):

bash
Copy code
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
Now you should be able to use the composer command.

Step 2: Install FPDF and FPDI with Composer
Run the following commands in your project directory to install FPDF and FPDI:

Install FPDF:

bash
Copy code
composer require setasign/fpdf
Install FPDI:

bash
Copy code
composer require setasign/fpdi
Install FPDI Protection (for adding encryption to the PDF):

bash
Copy code
composer require setasign/fpdi-protection

Alternatively, you can set an empty value for the http-proxy setting:

bash
Copy code disable proxy
composer config --global --unset http-proxy
composer config --global --unset https-proxy
